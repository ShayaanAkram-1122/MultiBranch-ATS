##  Key Features

##  Git Branching Strategy

We follow a feature-branch workflow:

```
main
└── feature/auth-jwt
└── feature/job-listings
└── feature/candidate-portal
└── feature/hr-dashboard
└── feature/email-notifications
└── feature/cloudinary-upload
```

All features are merged into `main` via **Pull Requests**.
